# NFL-web-scraping-players-statistics
In this project i used Beautiful Soup to scrap the web for the players statistics
Then you I used the input function so the statistics choice and the year need to be entered to be able to fetch the datafor the specific year
The data was saved in Excel file 
at the end i used the pandasgui to display the chart of the players statistics.
